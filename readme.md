# FaustFUN

Playing around with faust.

## Goal

- Short-term: Build some audio effects and a synth in Faust.
- Long-term: Build enough audio effects to produce full-length songs using exclusively Faust-coded effects and synths.

### Installation

- Option 1 (Local) - Download FaustLive and faust from source. I'm using a Faust VSCode extension. Compile with `faust` or just run in FaustLive.

- Option 2 (which they recommend in docs) - Use FaustIDE online. It's pretty neat.

### Resources

- [Faust Docs](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/)
- [Faust IDE](https://faustide.grame.fr/)

They also have a neat course linked in their docs. [Real Time Audio Signal Processing in Faust](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/real-time-audio-signal-processing-in-faust/info).
